    <h1>Design Scenario 1</h1>
    <p>
      Below is the optimized design for an MBB beam (a benchmark problem in topology optimization).
      It represents half of a simply supported beam with a downward force at the center.
      Please evaluate the design based on your engineering knowledge and experience.
      If you think certain members should be modified, please feel free to draw around them:
      click, hold, and drag your mouse to outline the region or interest. 
      If you need to delete certain region, click on it and hit backspace. 
      When finished, click "Finish Drawing."
